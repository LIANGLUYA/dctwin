## Use with Docker

Since the DCTwin is integrated with multiple third-party simulators,
we use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to manage each simulator to avoid potential conflicts.
Please refer to the [official installation guidance](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
if Docker is not installed in your machine.

**Step 1: Clone this repository**
```
$ cd <working directory>
$ git clone git@github.com:cap-dcwiz/dctwin.git
$ cd dctwin
```

**Step 2: Install DCTwin.** 

```
$ poetry install dctwin
```
Now, just have fun with it!
